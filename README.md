**Tests:** ![Test and Release](https://github.com/tp1de/ioBroker.ems-esp/workflows/Test%20and%20Release/badge.svg)

## Bosch / Buderus heating systems with km200 / IP-inside and/or ems-esp interface 

The adapter supports an interface towards the heating systems from Bosch Group using EMS or EMS+ bus. 
(Buderus / Junkers / Netfit etc). 

## It can interface towards the heating system with use of Web-API calls toward:

* km200, km200 hrv, km100, km50, HMC300 or IP-inside (from Bosch Group) 

* ems-esp gateway (https://github.com/emsesp/EMS-ESP32) with latest dev version (see below) and the ESP32 chip. 
  The old ESP8266 gateways with API V2 are NOT SUPPORTED ANYMORE !!
  The adapter is tested for the ems-esp gateway with latest firmware version (> V3.6.0) of ESP32

* New Bosch-Group Cloud-Gateways (MX300 / EasyControl ...) are not supported since they do not support LAN API !

The ioBroker ems-esp adapter can read and write data to both gateways to control all heating components. 
It can be used either for the original Bosch-Group gateways or the ems-esp or both in parallel.
All changed states from own scripts or the object browser does have to set acknowledged = false !!!


## NEW in Version >= 3.0.0: EMS+ entities (switchPrograms and holidayModes) are implemented for EMS-ESP gateway and if found states are created. 
	The ems-esp gateway firmware does not support switchPrograms and holidayModes for EMS+ thermostats (RC310 / RC300 or similar)
	Enabling this new function will issue raw telegrams toward the ems-esp gateway and then try to read the response.
	Testing is done for switchPrograms A and B for hc1 to hc4, dhw (warm water) and circulation pump (cp) and holidayModes hm1-hm5.
	The found extended entities are stored within instance settings. Therfore once an adapter instance restart will happen.
		
	Then after these found states the raw response is decoded and states are created similar to KM200 gateway API data.
	When the km200 gateway is enabled then this function is disabled to avoid double entries with same name.
	The states created consist of JSON structures, enum values or arrays and are writable - Be carefull with the right content.
	I recommend to test by using the Bosch/Buderus apps to identify the right content - especially for holidayModes.
	Polling is set to every 2 minutes.

## NEW Energy recordings and statistics need an active database instance. 
	Recordings require a InfluxDB adapter version >= 4.0.2 which allows deleting of db-records
	Retition period is now read and recordings are only stored within retention period -- Beta status
	InfluxDB v2 needs the retention period to be set to > 2 years for storing all historic values. 
	In V2 this is a global parameter for all states ! 
	
## NEW: Heat Demand hysteresis improved. 
	Switch heat demand on when actual temp <= settemp - delta
	Switch off when settemp < actual temp
	Do nothing between settemp - delta and settemp
	Make sure that delta is high enough to avoid too many boiler starts.

## NEW: Heat Demand parameters can be changed during active instance
	Heat demand parameters delta / weight for each thermostat can be changed within objects during active instance
	Remark: Updated weight is only used wen a new Heat Demand is found
	Heat demand parameters weighton / weightoff for each heating circuit can be changed within objects during active instance
